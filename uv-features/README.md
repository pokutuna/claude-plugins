# uv-features

Recommend lesser-known [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) features instead of traditional pip/venv/pyenv workflows.

## Skills

### uv-pep723

PEP 723 inline script metadata with `uv run`. Write standalone Python scripts with embedded dependencies — no project, venv, or requirements.txt needed.

### uv-tools

Run Python CLI tools (ruff, pytest, etc.) with `uvx` instead of `pip install` or `pipx`.

### uv-docker

Multi-stage Docker builds with uv for smaller, faster, and more cacheable Python container images.
